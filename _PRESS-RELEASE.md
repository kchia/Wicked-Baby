  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

Often, the feedback loop between a teacher's progressing instruction and a student's burgeoning comprehension is broken due to a lack of clear, honest and quick communication. Thumb-check-polls are a common pedagogical method used to ensure that teaching points are communicated effectively to student audiences. Students give a “thumbs up” to convey “I understand the lesson thus far” and a “thumbs down” to convey the opposite. The problem with the standard thumbs-check, however, is that many students who would otherwise raise a thumbs down, don't do so because of fear of judgement.

“Diss-No-Sense” seeks to improve the thumb-check poll in two ways. For students, Diss-No-Sense eliminates the anxiety associated with reporting a thumbs down through anonymous polling. For teachers, Diss-No-Sense visualizes polling results in a simple graph, allowing for a constant assessment of instructional success. 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
The standard thumbs-check-polling method used by teachers is not accurate because students often report a higher level of understanding due to the anxiety of raising a thumbs down in a classroom full of other students more successfully understanding a topic. 

When armed with accurate information regarding student performance, teachers are better prepared to address inconsistency, adjust the style of their presentation, or continue a discussion until all students develop an adequate understanding of the material.

 ## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
"Diss-No-Sense" circumvents the peer pressure issue by allowing students to anonymously submit information about their level of understanding without fear that their peers will judge them. Additionally, the app quantifies the students’ collective understanding of the lesson for the teacher, allowing the teacher to address student confusion on the fly.
